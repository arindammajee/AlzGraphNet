# AlzGraphNet: Alzheimer Detection from MRI scans with Graph Neural Networks

This repository contains a project that leverages advanced deep learning techniques, including graph-based neural networks, for the detection of Alzheimer's disease using MRI scans. The work focuses on constructing graphs from patches of 3D medical images and analyzing them using graph convolutional networks (GCNs), graph attention networks (GATs), and graph isomorphism networks (GINs).

The pipeline involves preprocessing MRI data, handling shape inconsistencies, creating graphs with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and training graph-based models for classification between Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Healthy Control (HC) groups.

# Approach

## Data Preprocessing:
- The pipeline begins by processing 3D MRI scans from the MIRIAD dataset.
- It resolves shape inconsistencies in the scans to ensure uniformity.
- The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets, ensuring a balanced distribution of AD and HC samples.

## Patch-Based Graph Construction:

MRI scans are divided into patches using a sliding window technique with specified kernel sizes and strides.
Each patch is treated as a node in the graph, and its features are derived from its pixel/voxel data.
Graph adjacency matrices are constructed using the KNN algorithm, ensuring each node is connected to its nearest neighbors.

## Graph Neural Networks:

Initially we have only used  Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). A structure of the GCN is here - 
```
GCN(
  (conv3d): Conv3d(1, 16, kernel_size=(3, 3, 3), stride=(1, 1, 1), padding=(1, 1, 1))
  (maxpool): MaxPool3d(kernel_size=3, stride=2, padding=1, dilation=1, ceil_mode=False)
  (conv3d_2): Conv3d(16, 32, kernel_size=(3, 3, 3), stride=(2, 2, 2), padding=(1, 1, 1))
  (maxpool_2): MaxPool3d(kernel_size=3, stride=2, padding=1, dilation=1, ceil_mode=False)
  (conv1): GCNConv(256, 32)
  (conv2): GCNConv(32, 16)
  (conv3): GCNConv(16, 8)
  (maxpool1d): MaxPool1d(kernel_size=64, stride=64, padding=0, dilation=1, ceil_mode=False)
  (avgpool1d): AvgPool1d(kernel_size=(64,), stride=(64,), padding=(0,))
  (fc1): Linear(in_features=128, out_features=256, bias=True)
  (fc2): Linear(in_features=256, out_features=64, bias=True)
  (fc3): Linear(in_features=128, out_features=256, bias=True)
  (fc4): Linear(in_features=256, out_features=64, bias=True)
  (classify): Linear(in_features=128, out_features=2, bias=True)
)
```
The models operate on graph representations of MRI scans, leveraging the spatial relationships between patches. We have kept the model lightweight (only **0.122394M** parameter) without compromising with it's efficiency. 

# Evaluation:

Performance is measured using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports.
The results demonstrate the efficacy of graph-based analysis in medical imaging.
